SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY CLASS NOTES
The following AMAF notes are intended to clarify the classes that follow.
1. CHORAL CLASS AGE LEVELS: In choral classes divided by age levels, the choir can be entered in the class
corresponding to the age of the oldest choir members or the class corresponding to the average age of all choir
members. If the latter option is chosen, the average age of choir members must be entered on the entry form.
2. CLASSROOM CHOIR: A Classroom Choir shall consist of 90% or more of the students in one classroom. The
total number of students shall not exceed 35. Choirs with more than 35 students should enter School Chorus
classes.
3. COMMUNITY BAND: An organized band that rehearses together regularly and is not directly affiliated with a
school.
4. COMMUNITY CHOIR: Community Choir shall include any group, the majority of whom are from a specified
geographical area or are connected through involvement in an organization/facility. This designation shall
include university and conservatory choruses.
5. DESIGNATION: Choirs must enter either School Choral classes or Community Choral classes and stay within
those classes for all choral entries. However, there may be National Choral classes that allow entries from both
School and Community Choirs.
6. FOLK SONG (Traditional or Traditional Style): Songs in any language, with the composer unknown, that
have endured and been passed down by oral tradition, often with considerable variation, or songs by known
composers (e.g. J.J. Niles, Ralph Vaughan Williams, etc.), in which the form and the sentiment are as in the
traditional folk songs.
7. GRADE: Refers to the school grade of the participants.
8. LANGUAGE: For selections sung in a language other than English, a translation must be provided with the
music.
9. SCHOOL CHORUS: A School Chorus may be composed of one grade or a combination of grades. In chorus
classes, it is not necessary to include students representing every grade specified in the class description.
School choirs that contain grade combinations other than those specified in particular classes in the syllabus
should enter the ‘ANY OTHER GRADE COMBINATION’ class.
10. SCHOOL CONTEMPORARY FOLK SONG/POPULAR MUSIC CHORUS: Contemporary folk music is most
often performed by experts and is transmitted in organized performances and commercially distributed
recordings (for example Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot, etc.) while popular music is of any genre of music with
current wide appeal and distribution (for example Amy Grant, Diana Krall, Josh Groban, etc.).
11. SUGGESTED REPERTOIRE LISTS: When reference is made to the Suggested Repertoire List for choral
classes, participants MUST choose a selection from the AMAF ‘Choral Suggested Repertoire List’ which can be
found at the end of this section. This repertoire can also be used as ‘own choice’ selections.
12. TRANSPOSITION: Transpositions will be allowed one tone or semitone up or down.
13. TWO-PART SONGS: Two-part songs are those that require a significant part of the song to be sung in two-part
harmony.

Trophy National Class, the ensemble must include from 8 to 12 members.)

NATIONAL CHORAL CLASSES
As per National Music Festival regulations, choirs must submit a CD or audio DVD recording of the performance on which

National Music Festival regulations, a local festival official must supervise and witness the recording of the performances of
choirs recommended for the Provincial and National levels of the competitions to ensure all regulations are followed. All
National Choral entries will be adjudicated in a closed session at the Provincial Festival. If recommended to the National
Music Festival, the same recording that was submitted for the Provincial Festival will be sent forward to the National Office.

SPEECH ARTS
Speech Arts classes with bolded titles and preceded by:
PSA are eligible for recommendation to the Speech Arts classes at the Provincial Festival
All grade levels in Speech Arts refer to school grades.
Provincial Festival eligibility begins with the School Grades 4-6 classes.
Please refer to the Definitions and Speech Arts Regulations at the beginning of the Syllabus.
SPEECH ARTS NOTES
The following AMAF notes are intended to clarify the classes that follow.
1. BIBLE READING: Participants will read a selection from the Bible (either Old or New Testament). Participants are
encouraged to use the King James Bible for its linguistic, artistic and technical demands, however other versions
are acceptable.
2. CLASSROOM SPEECH CHOIR: A Classroom Speech Choir is one that includes at least 90% of the members of a
classroom. This rule does not apply to non-competitive choirs.
3. CREATIVE POETRY OR PROSE READING/RECITATION: Entrants will read/recite their own work. Adjudication will
be on the basis of reading/recitative skills. The selection may be fiction or non-fiction. A copy of the work must
accompany the entry form. Participants performing from memory must indicate this clearly on their entry forms as the
local festival organization may wish to separate these entries from the reading entries.
4. CREATIVE STORYTELLING: Creative storytelling involves telling the entrant’s own story in a style that demands
direct and lively communication with the audience. Action and gesture should not overwhelm the story. It may be the
story of a real experience or an imaginary one. The aim of the classes is to celebrate the art of storytelling. No notes
may be used. An outline/map of the work must be submitted for the adjudicator. Suggestions may be made
concerning written work as it pertains to the oral communication, but will not be adjudicated.
5. DRAMATIC CHORAL SPEAKING: Work in this category can have body movement, gestures and some staging. If
props, costumes or scenery are used they must be minimal and/or of a ‘suggestive’ nature only. Participants will be
allowed no more than five minutes ‘set-up’ time. Work may be humorous or serious. It will be judged at the
adjudicator’s discretion on the basis of technical and artistic merit, degree of difficulty and suitability for the ages
involved.
6. HOLY BOOK OTHER THAN BIBLE: May be from such Holy books as the Talmud and the Koran. If the selection is
read in a language other than English, a translation must be provided for the adjudicator.
7. IMPROMPTU SPEECHES: The adjudicator chooses the topic and the participants are given a set time to prepare
their speech. Notes may be used.
8. LIMERICKS: A light humorous, nonsensical, or bawdy verse of five anapestic lines usually with the rhyme scheme aabba.
9. MONOLOGUE: A dramatic piece for a single performer, or a long speech from a play in which a single character
speaks. Memorization is mandatory. Staging, minimal props and costumes are permitted. The adjudicator may
question the monologue in relation to the rest of the play.
10. PREPARED PUBLIC SPEAKING: Entrants must present persuasive, informative or entertaining speeches that
they have prepared themselves. Participants are encouraged to use notes.
11. PROSE: A prose selection may be fiction or non-fiction from a published story, essay novel or similar work.
12. READINGS: The selection must be READ, not memorized. Consideration should be given to eye contact,
position/grasp on the book, stance and fluency.
13. SPOKEN POETRY: Spoken Poetry is an oral interpretation of a poem that has been memorized. Participants enter
according to school grade level.
14. STORYTELLING: In these classes, entrants will adapt a traditional story, folk tale, family tale, legend, fable or myth
and retell it in her/his own words. Sounds, props and movement may be incorporated into the performance. No notes
may be used. An outline/map of the story must be provided for the adjudicator. Suggestions may be made
concerning written work as it pertains to the oral communication, but will not be adjudicated.

15. SUGGESTED REPERTOIRE LISTS: When reference is made to the Suggested Repertoire List for Speech Arts
classes, participants MUST choose a selection from the AMAF Suggested Repertoire List which can be found at the end
of this section. These selections are published in and can be photocopied from the AMAF Speech Arts Manual volumes.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The local festivals, may, at their discretion, add or delete regulations using their local festival addendum, providing they do
not pertain to requirements of Provincial Music & Arts Festival eligible classes. All Provincial Music & Arts Festival eligible
classes must follow the Provincial Music & Arts Festival Regulations.
Local festival organizations reserve the right to set their own age limits except in vocal classes where age groups have been
listed to defined levels. Please note that National classes have age restrictions which are defined in the National Syllabus
that is available through the Federation of Canadian Music Festivals (online at www.fcmf.org).
Marking: A local festival may be competitive, non-competitive or a combination of both. If a festival is competitive, the
percentage system, the letter grade system, a gold/silver/bronze type system or a combination of all three may be used. The
following marking system is recommended by AMAF:
Grading

The local festival may, at the discretion of the local committee, subdivide or combine classes. They may also create new
classes to accommodate entries not eligible in existing classes. These classes will not have Provincial Festival eligibility.
Access Copyright License
AMAF secures an Access Copyright license which gives festivals the copying rights they need for speech arts classes.
Festival participants may reproduce selections from the AMAF Speech Arts Manual or other source without tracking copies.
Use of reproductions is restricted to preparation for, and participation in, the Provincial Festival or an AMAF affiliated festival.
In all Speech Arts classes, an original or a photocopy of each selection must be provided for the adjudicator prior to the
commencement of the class. If the piece is not memorized - e.g. a reading - the participant must also have an original or
photocopy of the selection for their own use.

Random HouseTHEATRE ARTS
Theatre Arts Classes are divided into the following sections: Drama; Puppetry; Mime; Reader’s Theatre;
Musical Theatre; Film and Video.
Please check your local festival addendum for details regarding the Theatre Arts Classes.
All grade levels in Theatre Arts refer to school grades.
GENERAL THEATRE ARTS REGULATIONS
The local festivals, may, at their discretion, add or delete regulations using their local festival addendum, providing they do
not pertain to requirements of Provincial Music & Arts Festival eligible classes. All Provincial Music & Arts Festival eligible
classes must follow the Provincial Music & Arts Festival Regulations.
Local festival organizations reserve the right to set their own age limits except in vocal classes where age groups have been
listed to defined levels. Please note that National classes have age restrictions which are defined in the National Syllabus
that is available through the Federation of Canadian Music Festivals (online at www.fcmf.org).
Marking: A local festival may be competitive, non-competitive or a combination of both. If a festival is competitive, the
percentage system, the letter grade system, a gold/silver/bronze type system or a combination of all three may be used. The
following marking system is recommended by AMAF:

The local festival may, at the discretion of the local committee, subdivide or combine classes. They may also create new
classes to accommodate entries not eligible in existing classes. These classes will not have Provincial Festival eligibility.
Access Copyright License
AMAF secures an Access Copyright license which gives festivals the copying rights they need for speech arts classes.
Festival participants may reproduce selections from the AMAF Speech Arts Manual or other source without tracking copies.
Use of reproductions is restricted to preparation for, and participation in, the Provincial Festival or an AMAF affiliated festival.
In all Speech Arts classes, an original or a photocopy of each selection must be provided for the adjudicator prior to the
commencement of the class. If the piece is not memorized - e.g. a reading - the participant must also have an original or
photocopy of the selection for their own use.

General Procedures
a. The festival organization will determine the order in which participants will perform. Any participant not ready to compete
when called upon may be disqualified.
b. The decision of the adjudicator regarding ranking of participants must be accepted as final. At no time may anyone
approach the adjudicator to discuss the matter.
If permitted at the local festival, video and/or audio recording must be unobtrusive and done with the permission of the
performer (or parent/guardian if the performer is under 18 years of age). Adjudications may not be recorded (video or
audio) under any circumstances.
c.
d.
e.
The local festival may, at the discretion of the local committee, subdivide or combine classes. They may also create
new classes to accommodate entries not eligible in existing classes.
Festivals are not responsible for any aspect of the production other than to provide the performance space. Securing,
storage and removal of all stage properties is the responsibility of the performing group.
DRAMA CLASSES
CREATED SCRIPT: (ALSO REFERRED TO AS COLLECTIVE CREATION)
These are original presentations developed by the group (not written by one individual) on any subject matter or theme. Plays in
this category may have either a script or a story outline. The characters and the story line are not adapted from any existing
work, but are created from scratch through improvisation and rehearsal. An exception to this would be documentary drama, in
which historical, political, or social themes and their characters and situations may be pulled from “real life” and incorporated into
a play, for example, a play about the history of the City of Dauphin, or a play about old age.

DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES
A dramatic monologue is a dramatic piece for a single performer, or a long speech from a play in which a single character
speaks. The scene may be staged with movement along with use of simple set pieces, costumes and props. The piece will be
adjudicated primarily on the strength of the interpretation and the believability of the character. Participants are advised to read
the whole play and be aware of the character’s role and development throughout the play. It is not necessary to use an accent.
Monologue classes are also offered under Speech Arts. One selection. Please check your local festival addendum for time
limits.

READER’S THEATRE CLASSES
In Reader’s Theatre, scripts are handheld. Creative methods may be used to approximate entrances, exits, stage movements or
action, lighting, sets or props. Often the form consists simply of stools on which the readers sit with minimal light by which to
read. Tableaux or slides may be used to give the audience a visual focus while they listen. Reader’s Theatre is similar to radio
drama in that audience attention is caught and held through the actor’s involvement in the characters. Not all plays are suitable
for use in Reader’s Theatre; those which do not require a great deal of visual movement and action to keep the audience
interested work best. Prose pieces can be adapted for these classes. Own choice. Please check your local festival addendum
for time limits.

CREATIVE MOVEMENT CLASSES
Creative movement is the process of discovering the range of human movement through the body’s use of surrounding space,
efforts (energy release and muscle control) and shapes. Creative movement can explore the movement qualities of human
emotion and its expression. The dance itself then becomes an expression of the dancer.
The dance may be narrative (tells a story) or abstract (movement which does not tell a story). The dance may be performed to
music (for example, classical or contemporary), percussion (for example, clapping) or various other media including poetry or
silence. Dance training is not necessarily required.

ACTION SONGS AND SINGING GAMES CLASSES
Classes for action songs and singing games are offered both under School Choral classes and Dance. Action songs/singing
games entered in School Choral will be judged on singing. The same action song/singing game may be entered in both Dance
and School Choral classes, if desired.
An action song or singing game requires the participation of the entire class in both singing and action. If it is not possible to
have the entire class involved, at least 90% of the class should participate. Action songs/singing games involve appropriate
gestures and actions, moving in patterns, or dancing with ensemble singing. Props or musical instruments may be used, for
example, sticks, poi balls, artwork, etc.

Classes are open to non-professionals who reside or study in the Province of Manitoba, or who are residents of
Manitoba, studying outside the province. A non-professional in visual arts is defined as:

one whose principal means of livelihood is not obtained from the practice of artistic services in the particular
category in which he or she is competing;

one who does not hold a diploma, degree, etc. in fine or applied art;

one who does not teach or has not taught art in an art school – fine or applied art;

one who does not exhibit work frequently;

one who has not won important national or international prizes in fine or applied art;

one who is not an artist member of an art academy;

one who is not recognized as a professional artist by other professional artists in the country
The age of the competitor shall be taken as of December 31 st of the festival year.
Participants may enter more than one work of art provided that each work is of a different medium. For example, an
individual may enter one work in oil and one work in acrylics.
No entry may compete against itself.
All Visual Arts entries must be clearly labeled. Please see local festival addendum for particulars.
Original Work
Original work should be stressed at all times. Patterns, kits, pre-fabricated molds, copies and tracings do not qualify as
original work. In the case of school entries, teachers may introduce a broad theme but the interpretation of the theme or
subject should be the student’s. Projects where every student does the same thing with slight variations (e.g. colour),
are not classified as original work.

Marking
Visual Arts specialists who have drawn up this program strongly recommend that Visual Arts classes be non-
competitive, particularly classes for Kindergarten through to Grade 9.

In a competitive class, the decision of the adjudicator regarding ranking of participants must be accepted as final.
