A non-profit, charitable organization, the Associated Manitoba Arts Festivals (AMAF) supports festivals in promoting
and encouraging the development and growth of the performing and creative arts. AMAF also serves as host of the
annual Provincial Music & Speech Arts Finals that brings together the winners from local festivals across the
province and sends some of Manitoba’s most talented senior musicians to the National Music Festival.
AMAF is a provincial organization, providing programs, resources and services for affiliated festivals in Manitoba
including: this Provincial Syllabus; an Index of Arts Specialists, an Adjudicator Training program; Festival Handbook;
Manitoba Composition Competition. Each year festival representatives from all over Manitoba meet for the AMAF
Annual Conference and AGM to share ideas and expertise with one another.
The high levels of participation in the festivals and the tremendous number of hours of volunteer time given to keep
the festival movement alive and strong indicate the importance of festivals to the communities. There are over 4000
volunteer hours donated annually to festivals and more than 65,000 children and adults performing each year.
PURPOSE
“The purpose of the Associated Manitoba Arts Festivals Inc. is to
promote and encourage participation in,
growth and development of,
and appreciation for the creative and performing arts
in partnership with local festivals.”
STATEMENT OF BELIEF
“AMAF believes that an individual should have the opportunity
to participate in arts activities at any level,
to experience personal growth
and to develop their skills and an appreciation for the arts.
AMAF believes that the arts should be an integral part of a person’s life,
and that festivals should be a positive developmental experience.”
Many thanks to the Department of Culture, Heritage,Tourism and Sport
for their continued support of AMAF and the arts in Manitoba!
In Recognition of our Volunteers

The Provincial Music & Speech Arts Finals is an annual provincial competition involving festival participants from across the
Province of Manitoba. From its first year in 1972, the goal of the Provincial Finals has been to present the opportunity for
talented young musicians and speech artists, who have been awarded the chance to represent their local festival, to develop
their skills in a supportive, yet competitive environment. Local festivals may send representatives in the areas of Voice, Piano,
Strings, Classical Guitar, Woodwinds, Brass, Percussion, Chamber Group, Poetry and Prose, and Public Speaking. They may
also send Choral entries on CD to be adjudicated. Scholarships are awarded in each class and the most advanced music
performers and most outstanding choral entries are eligible to be recommended to represent Manitoba at the National Music
Festival.
Each AMAF Affiliated festival is entitled to send participants to represent their community at the Provincial Finals. Participants
must be recommended by their adjudicator from a Provincial Finals eligible class. Classes eligible for recommendation to the
Provincial Finals are identified in the Syllabus by a ‘P’ preceding the class number and the class name printed in bold font. Solo
and Chamber Music classes are divided into four levels and Speech Arts classes are divided into two levels:

Speech Arts classes with bolded titles and preceded by a PSA are eligible for recommendation to the
Provincial Finals.
All grade levels in Speech Arts refer to school grades.
Classes eligible for recommendation to the Provincial Finals begin at Grade 7.
SPEECH ARTS DEFINITIONS
The following AMAF definitions are intended to clarify the classes that follow.
1. BIBLE READING: Participants will read a selection from the Bible (either Old or New Testament). It is
suggested that participants use the King James Bible for its majesty of language and taxing breath control,
however other versions are acceptable.
2. CLASSROOM SPEECH CHOIR: A Classroom Speech Choir is one that includes at least 90% of the members
of a classroom. This rule does not apply to non-competitive choirs.
3. CREATIVE POETRY OR PROSE READING/RECITATION: Entrants will read/recite their own work.
Adjudication will be on the basis of reading/recitative skills. The selection may be fiction or non-fiction. A copy
of the work must accompany the entry form. Participants performing from memory must indicate this clearly on
their entry forms as the local festival organization may wish to separate these entries from the reading entries.
4. CREATIVE STORYTELLING: Creative storytelling involves telling the entrant‟s own story. It may be the story
of a real experience or an imaginary one. Local history is suggested as one source of material for these
classes. The aim of the classes is to revive the dying art of storytelling. A copy of the work must be submitted
for the adjudicator. Suggestions may be made concerning written work as it pertains to the oral communication,
but will not be adjudicated.
5. DRAMATIC CHORAL SPEAKING: Work in this category can have body movement, gestures and some
staging. If props, costumes or scenery are used they must be minimal and/or of a „suggestive‟ nature only.
Participants will be allowed no more than five minutes „set-up‟ time. Work may be humorous or serious. It will
be judged at the adjudicator‟s discretion on the basis of technical and artistic merit, degree of difficulty and
suitability for the ages involved.
6. HOLY BOOK OTHER THAN BIBLE: May be from such Holy books as the Talmud and the Koran. If the
selection is read in a language other than English, a translation must be provided for the adjudicator.
7. IMPROMPTU SPEECHES: The adjudicator chooses the topic and the participants each have 15 minutes to
prepare. Notes may be used.
8. LIMERICKS: A light humorous, nonsensical, or bawdy verse of five anapestic lines usually with the rhyme
scheme aabba.
9. MONOLOGUE: A dramatic piece for a single performer, or a long speech from a play in which a single
character speaks. It must be memorized. It is recommended that if the speech is from a play, the participant
read the entire play prior to performing the excerpt as the adjudicator may question the monologue in relation to
the rest of the play.
10. PREPARED PUBLIC SPEAKING: Entrants must present speeches that they have prepared themselves.
Participants are encouraged to use notes.
11. PROSE: A prose selection may be fiction or non-fiction from a published story, essay novel or similar work.
12. READINGS: The selection must be READ, not memorized.
13. SPOKEN POETRY: Spoken Poetry is an oral interpretation of a poem that has been memorized. Participants
enter according to school grade level.
14. STORYTELLING: In these classes, entrants will be required to learn the content of a story and tell it in her/his
own words. A copy of the story must be provided for the adjudicator. Suggestions may be made concerning
written work as it pertains to the oral communication, but will not be adjudicated.
15. SUGGESTED REPERTOIRE LISTS: When reference is made to the Suggested Repertoire List for Speech
Arts classes, participants MUST choose a selection from the AMAF Suggested Repertoire List which can be
found at the end of this section.

of delivery, and appeal to the audience. Topics will be own choice provided that they focus on Canada or some aspect of

CREATED SCRIPT: (ALSO REFERRED TO AS COLLECTIVE CREATION)
These are original presentations developed by the group (not written by one individual) on any subject matter or theme. Plays in
this category may have either a script or a story outline. The characters and the story line are not adapted from any existing
work, but are created from scratch through improvisation and rehearsal. An exception to this would be documentary drama, in
which historical, political, or social themes and their characters and situations may be pulled from “real life” and incorporated into
a play, for example, a play about the history of the City of Dauphin, or a play about old age.

In Reader’s Theatre, scripts are held in the hand, and no attempt is made to approximate entrances, exits, stage movements or
action, lighting, sets or props. Often the form consists simply of stools on which the readers sit and enough light by which to
read. Tableaux or slides may sometimes be used to give the audience a visual focus while they listen. Reader’s Theatre is
similar to radio drama in that audience attention is caught and held through the actor’s involvement in the characters. Not all
plays are suitable for use in Reader’s Theatre; those which do not require a great deal of visual movement and action to keep the
audience interested work best. Own choice. Please check your local festival addendum for time limits.

Creative movement is the process of discovering the range of human movement through the body’s use of surrounding space,
efforts (energy release and muscle control) and shapes. Creative movement can explore the movement qualities of human
emotion and its expression. The dance itself then becomes an expression of the dancer.
The dance may be narrative (tells a story) or abstract (movement which does not tell a story). The dance may be performed to
music (for example, classical or contemporary), percussion (for example, clapping) or various other media including poetry or
silence. Dance training is not necessarily required.

All grade levels in Visual Arts refer to school grade level.
Visual Arts classes are divided into the following sections:
VA 1000 PAINTING VA 1140 PRINTMAKING
VA 1010 DRAWING VA 1160 FIBRE ARTS
VA 1020 CARTOONING VA 1170 PUPPETRY
VA 1030 POSTERS VA 1190 PHOTOGRAPHY

VA 1110 CERAMICS/POTTERY
Many of these sections have been subdivided. Each subsection is also classified according to the grade level of the
participants. Although grades have been used to determine classes, Visual Arts classes are in no way restricted to
school entries. Any entries coming from outside the school, for example, home or art club, should still be entered in
the class corresponding to the school grade level. Adult classes are also listed.
VISUAL ARTS REGULATIONS
The local festivals, may, at their discretion, add or delete regulations using the local festival addendum.

Classes are open to non-professionals who reside or study in the Province of Manitoba, or who are residents of
Manitoba, studying outside the province. A non-professional in visual arts is defined as:

one whose principal means of livelihood is not obtained from the practice of artistic services in the particular
category in which he or she is competing;

one who does not hold a diploma, degree, etc. in fine or applied art;

one who does not teach or has not taught art in an art school – fine or applied art;

one who does not exhibit work frequently;

one who has not won important national or international prizes in fine or applied art;

one who is not an artist member of an art academy;

one who is not recognized as a professional artist by other professional artists in the country
st
The age of the competitor shall be taken as of December 31 of the festival year.
Participants may enter more than one work of art provided that each work is of a different medium. For example, an
individual may enter one work in oil and one work in acrylics.
No entry may compete against itself.
All Visual Arts entries must be clearly labeled. Please see local festival addendum for particulars.
Original Work
Original work should be stressed at all times. Patterns, kits, pre-fabricated molds, copies and tracings do not qualify as
original work. In the case of school entries, teachers may introduce a broad theme but the interpretation of the theme or
subject should be the student’s. Projects where every student does the same thing with slight variations (e.g. colour),
are not classified as original work.
4.
Marking
Visual Arts specialists who have drawn up this program strongly recommend that Visual Arts classes be non-
competitive, particularly classes for Kindergarten through to Grade 9.
5.
General Procedures

b.
In a competitive class, the decision of the adjudicator regarding ranking of participants must be accepted as final.
The local festival may, at the discretion of the local committee, subdivide or combine classes. They may also create
new classes to accommodate entries not eligible in existing classes.
